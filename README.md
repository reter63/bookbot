# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

Run with a path to a text file (i.e. python3 main.py <path_to_book>).

Reads the file and prints to the console the number of words in the file as well as a sorted list of the characters in the text with the number of times they occured.
